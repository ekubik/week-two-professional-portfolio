# Professional Portfolio

This project involved building a professional portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer, using HTML and CSS. The completed project had to adhere to the following user story, and acceptance criteria.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

```

A variety of HTML and CSS properties needed to be used in order to create a portfolio which satisfied all the above criteria. These included: flexbox, media queries, css variables. The result was a portfolio that displayed the developer's work and contact information. The site incorporates elements of responsive design as the layout adapts depending on the size of the screen that it is being viewed on.
